**About SnapKey** 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SnapKey provides a user-friendly alternative to the Razer Snap Tap function, making it accessible across all keyboards!

SnapKey is a lightweight, open-source tool that operates from the system tray and is designed to track inputs from the WASD keys, without interfering with any game files. Its main role is to recognize when these keys are pressed and automatically release any previously engaged commands for them. This guarantees responsive and precise input handling. SnapKey handles the WASD keys by default and lets you rebind them to your liking via the config file.

**SnapKey Pro in Action**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- When you press and hold down the **"A"** key, SnapKey remembers it.
- If you then press the **"D"** key while still holding down **"A"** SnapKey automatically releases the **"A"** key for you.
- The same happens if you press **"A"** while holding **"D"** — SnapKey releases the **"D"** key.
- When you press Left Click to shoot. your movement kees become inactive, to stop you from moving while firing, thus increasing accuracy.
  
**SnapKey prevents simultaneous movement key conflicts (AD / WS)**

- In many FPS games, pressing both the **"A"** and **"D"** keys simultaneously typically results in the game recognizing conflicting inputs. SnapKey automatically releases the previously held key when a new key input is detected.
- The keys are separated into two different groups: A/D and W/S. In each group, **"A"** cancels out **"D"** and vice versa, while the same applies to **"W"** and **"S"**. These groups do not interfere with each other and work separately.

**Sticky Keys**

- Sticky Keys is a feature that keeps track of the state of a key you've pressed down. For example, if you 
hold down the **"A"** key and tap the **"D"** key repeatedly, each press of **"D"** will temporarily override 
the **"A"** key. When you release the **"D"** key, the action associated with the **"A"** key will resume, as 
long as you're still holding it down. The same principle applies if you start with **"D"** held down and 
press **"A"** instead.
- Same goes for the Left Click as well. When any movement key is pressed down and Left Click is pressed, each click overrides the movement key. When you release the Left Click, the movement keys will resume, as 
long as you're still holding it down.
