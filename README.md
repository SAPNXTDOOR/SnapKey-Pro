# SnapKey Pro

SnapKey Pro provides a user-friendly alternative to the **Razer Snap Tap** feature, making it accessible on **any keyboard**.

It is a lightweight open-source Windows utility that runs in the **system tray** and manages movement key inputs to prevent conflicts. SnapKey Pro listens to keyboard inputs and automatically releases previously held movement keys when an opposite key is pressed, ensuring **responsive and precise movement control** in games.

SnapKey Pro does **not modify or interact with any game files** and works entirely through the **Windows API**.

## How SnapKey Pro Works

### Basic Example

1. Hold **A**
2. Press **D**
3. SnapKey Pro automatically releases **A**
4. Only **D** remains active

If you press **A** again while holding **D**, SnapKey Pro releases **D**.

This ensures there is **never conflicting input between opposite movement keys**.

---

## SOCD Handling (AD / WS)

Movement keys are divided into two independent groups:

| Axis       | Keys  |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Horizontal | A / D |
| Vertical   | W / S |

Within each group:

* **A cancels D**
* **D cancels A**
* **W cancels S**
* **S cancels W**

The two groups operate **independently**, so pressing W and A together works normally.

---

## Sticky Keys System

Sticky Keys keeps track of held keys and restores them after temporary overrides.

Example:

1. Hold **A**
2. Tap **D**
3. D temporarily overrides A
4. Release D
5. **A resumes automatically**

This makes movement feel **smooth and responsive** during rapid direction changes.

The same behavior applies to **mouse override**:

* When **Left Click** is pressed while moving, movement inputs can temporarily pause.
* Once the click is released, movement resumes if the key is still held.

---

## Mouse Override

Mouse override prevents unintended movement while firing.

When **Left Click** is pressed:

* Movement inputs can be temporarily disabled
* This improves **shooting accuracy** in certain scenarios.

---

## Hotkeys Configuration

SnapKey Pro supports **custom global hotkeys**.

Hotkeys are configured in:

```
hotkeys.txt
```

Example:

```
toggle_snapkey=Ctrl+Alt+S
toggle_socd_x=Ctrl+L
toggle_socd_y=Ctrl+Shift+1
toggle_mouse_override=F13
toggle_mouse_override_x=Alt+F14
toggle_mouse_override_y=Ctrl+Alt+F15
```

Supported keys:

* A-Z
* 0-9
* F1–F24
* Ctrl
* Alt
* Shift
* Win

Hotkeys can combine multiple modifiers:

```
Ctrl+Shift+F12
Alt+F14
Ctrl+Alt+S
```

After editing hotkeys:

1. Right-click the tray icon
2. Click **Restart**

or restart the application.
